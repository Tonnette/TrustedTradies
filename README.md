## Description

### Customer Story
>As a customer, I want to be able to easily search multiple tradies in my area, I want to see their rates, what kind of reviews they have, and then I want to connect with the tradies that I choose. I also want to leave reviews for any tradies that work for me, so I can share my experience with others. 


### Motivation to create this app
I wanted to be able to easily search multiple tradies, see their rates, what kind of reviews they have, and then connect with the tradies that I choose.

Currently there is no app that provides this service. The current apps requires the customer to complete a lot of information, including the work required, and then the tradies choose to connect with them based on the job. That’s not how I want to connect. I want to be in control of who I choose to work with. I want to do this easily and simply. I don’t want to complete endless forms. And I want the experience to be enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing.

## How to Use

This web applicaiton has been deployed on Heroku so you are welcome to use it anytime you want.

Click to use: https://vast-chamber-54344.herokuapp.com/

On the main page, if the user does not login, they can click on any tradies card, or search a particular tradie in their area.  To find out more information on the tradies, the user must register / login to make contact it tradie, and leave a review of their own. 

If tradies register, they can upload a photo and complete a profile, they then are able to update and delete this profile if they choose. 

There are different "looks" to the site, based on whether there is no-on logged in (green), a user is logged in (orange) or a tradie is logged in (bue).

The user can also click logout to log out and return to home page.

## Directions for Future Development

I would like to add the ability for the tradie to upload multiple photos to their profile so they can advertise their work even better. 

I would like to add the profile feature for users too, so they can add a photo of themselves, and update and delete their profile. This could be useful so that tradies can see who they are chatting with. 

At this point users can log in to see the tradies phone number and email address, but in the future, I would also like to add a message feature within the app so that tradies and customers could chat without leaving the website.
